# Data-Manipulation-with-Test
Java, Streams &amp; Junit

Let's say we want to create a movie, and have a responsibility for EUR 10 million of budget. To be able to make decisions, we should know a little bit more about movies. 
Luckily, there are some datasets easily available online. [For example, Kaggle offers large collections of datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) from which we have taken a dataset with all movie data from the program. 

You're not allowed to use any for loops in Java. All functionality can be accessed through the Stream API in Java 8. It allows you to manipulate strings and large datasets.
